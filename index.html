              This page is being built with two purposes in mind. The first is to meet the requirements of freecodecamp.com to "Build a Product Landing Page". The second is to build a page that may be incorporated into my Hodgepodge. This section will disappear when this is incorporated into my pages.

                <p>Penn State researchers have devoleped a device powered by the movements of the person wearing it. The energy is stored as electrical energy in micro-super capacitors. They designed a wearable sensor for detecting blood pressure and movement using a small skin patch made of tissue paper. The paper was dipped into conductive material  to become a sensor that sticks to the skin. </p>

                <p>To help save the earth, we only use recycled eletrons. With these, it takes a few microseconds to prepare the product. Once assembeled, we send it out to you at a speed of  186,000 miles per second.  Whe they arrive, it may be advisable to stand to one side of your display. I don't want anyone to get hurt. It is a wonder that the electrons are able to stay within the circuts as they round so many corners.</p>
